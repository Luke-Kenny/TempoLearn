You are an AI academic assistant. Convert the following academic content into structured, thesis-level notes for postgraduate study.

CONTENT:
"""
${parsedText}
"""

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Write a high-level academic summary (2-3 paragraphs), with clear structure and insight.
- Extract 4-8 key academic terms or concepts relevant to the material.
- Suggest visuals that aid conceptual understanding (e.g., flowcharts, models).
- Generate 3-5 notable study insights or observations â€” compact, powerful, and actionable. These should resemble margin notes, critical takeaways, or "NB" points.
- Do not include markdown, headings, explanations, or extra commentary.

RETURN ONLY valid JSON in this format:
{
  "summary": "Your academic summary here...",
  "keyConcepts": [
    "Key Term 1",
    "Key Term 2",
    ...
  ],
  "visualSuggestions": [

    "Flowchart of framework B",
    ...
