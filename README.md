# TempoLearn

**TempoLearn** is a modern learning management platform built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Material-UI**. The project is deployed on **Firebase Hosting** with a custom domain and includes an "under development" page as the current production view. This setup demonstrates high-quality frontend development practices and lays the groundwork for future integrations with additional backend services and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed (recommended version: `18.x` or above).
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js.
- **Firebase CLI**: Install globally for Firebase Hosting deployment:
  ```bash
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TempoLearn.git
   cd TempoLearn
   ```

2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open the app in your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## 🌐 Deployment to Firebase Hosting

### Firebase Hosting Setup
1. **Build the production app**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This generates the production-ready files in the `dist` folder.

2. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting**:
   - Ensure Firebase CLI is logged in:
     ```bash
     firebase login
     ```
   - Deploy the app:
     ```bash
     firebase deploy
     ```

3. **Custom Domain**:
   - The app is deployed to the custom domain: [www.tempolearn.org](http://www.tempolearn.org).
   - DNS records were configured via Namecheap to point to Firebase Hosting.

## 🔐 Firebase Authentication

We have integrated **Firebase Authentication** to enable user login.

### **Setup Firebase Authentication**
1. Go to **Firebase Console → Authentication**.
2. Enable **Email/Password Authentication** or other desired providers.
3. Add authentication logic to the frontend using Firebase SDK.

Example for Email/Password Login:
```typescript
import { getAuth, signInWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth();
signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
  .then((userCredential) => {
    const user = userCredential.user;
    console.log("User logged in:", user);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Login failed:", error.message);
  });
```

## 🚀 CI/CD: Automatic Deployments with GitHub Actions

We have implemented **GitHub Actions** for **automated Firebase deployments**.

### **How It Works**
1. **Every push to `main` triggers a deployment**.
2. **GitHub Actions runs build & deploy commands automatically**.
3. **Live site is updated without manual intervention**.

### **Trigger a Manual Deployment**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeployment"
git push origin main
```
