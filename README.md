# TempoLearn

**TempoLearn** is a modern learning management platform built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Material-UI**. The project is deployed on **Firebase Hosting** with a custom domain and includes an "under development" page as the current production view. This setup demonstrates high-quality frontend development practices and lays the groundwork for future integrations with additional backend services and CI/CD pipelines.
